# Task_Scheduling_Using_FreeRTOS
In this project FreeRTOS is used to manage multiple tasks running on the STM32 microcontroller. Task scheduling ensures efficient execution of sensor monitoring, data processing, and actuator control while maintaining system responsiveness.FreeRTOS uses a preemptive priority-based scheduler. Scheduler switches between tasks based on their states.
